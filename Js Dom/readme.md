``` val = document.all[0]; ``` -> we can access the index/item of the html element
``` val = document.all.length; ``` -> the number of elemnts in the DOM
``` val = document.all.body ``` -> we can access the elemts of the DOM such as body, head, etc..
``` val = document.all.head ``` ->
``` val = document.all.doctype ``` ->
``` val = document.all.domain ``` ->
``` val = document.all.URL ``` ->
